# document_rag_bot

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## Poetry

This project uses poetry. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m document_rag_bot
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload and exposed ports add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here. 

All environment variables should start with "DOCUMENT_RAG_BOT_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "document_rag_bot/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "DOCUMENT_RAG_BOT_RANDOM_PARAMETER" 
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `document_rag_bot.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
DOCUMENT_RAG_BOT_RELOAD="True"
DOCUMENT_RAG_BOT_PORT="8000"
DOCUMENT_RAG_BOT_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* black (formats your code);
* mypy (validates types);
* ruff (spots possible bugs);

```bash
docker-compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose down
```

For running tests on your local machine.
